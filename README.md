# An Evening of Python and QGIS

Welcome! We are going to explore some basic functionalities of QGIS and Python. Given the high speed of QGIS development we will use the long-term release (version 2.18/Python 2.7).

https://docs.qgis.org/2.18/en/docs/pyqgis_developer_cookbook/index.html (long-term release documentation)


To keep things simple we are going to run the script from the internal QGIS Python Console. You will need to download the example data from the links below.

## Installation files
